# base-converter

Small command line utilities to convert from and to hexadecimal, octal, binary, base64, etc.

The idea is to learn to use spring shell by doing a small application that can have a true utility even if limited.

Convert from and to base64 is not complicated and there is already utilities that can do that.
However, it can come in handy that you have a command-line tools to do this kind of conversion rapidly in the console.

The prime idea is to develop a spring boot/spring shell application that can convert to and from :

* base64
* hexadecimal
* octal
* binary
* classic timestamp in second in a date
